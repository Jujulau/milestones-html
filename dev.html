        <h1>Development Environment</h1>
        <p>On this page, we will be talking about your development environment! First, you want to start getting <b>REAL</b> comfortable with your <b>Command Line</b>.</p>

        <h2>Command Line</h2>
        <p>Since I'm using a macbook, the shortcut that I use to open my terminal is:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use command + space to open spotlight search</li>
            <img src="macos-spotlight-intro.jpg" width="300px"/>
            <li>Then type "terminal" and it should open the terminal</li>

        </ul>

        <p>Ima show you other things you could do once you open your command line</p>

        <ul>
            <li><i>cd</i> is used to call up directories. as you can see, I used "~" which is a shortcut and so you don't have to type in your user name -- "/Users/julialau" </li>
            <li><i>ls</i> is used to list the contents of a directory -- it displays the other folders and files.</li>
            <li><i>mkdir</i> allows you to make a new directory -- I named the new folder in that directory as "new".</li>
            <li><i>touch</i> is used to create a new file -- I named the new file as "index.html" and it's placed in the "milestones-html" directory.</li>
            <li><i>code .</i> allows you to open this directory in VS code -- I had trouble doing this because I didn't have this command downloaded in VS code. So if you want to use this shortcut, check out the screenshot below!</li>
