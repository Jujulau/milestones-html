        <h1>HTML Fundamentals</h1>
            <p>The &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; tag required for every html page so that the web page is viewed in the same way, even in different web browsers.</p>
            <p>The &lt;html lang='en'&gt; tag is used to indicate that the page will be displaying html. The lang='en' part is to let the page know that the web page is in english.</p><br>
            <p>The &lt;head&gt; tag is used to include the title of your webpage, any search items, and other items that aren't physically shown on the webpage itself.</p>
            <pre>
                The &lt;title&gt; tag is shown on the tab of the web page like this:
            </pre>
            <img src="html.png"/>

            <p>Everything inside the &lt;body&gt; tag is displayed on the web page.</p>
            <p>As you can see all the way on the top, HTML fundamentals is shown in bold and a large font-size -- a heading. This is accomplished through the &lt;h1&gt; tag.</p>
            <p>And the way that I have been describing this whole process -- in paragraphs -- was done through &lt;p&gt; tags.</p>
            <p>Now, I'm going to show you a similar heading to the one shown all the way on the top. However, it's going to be a smaller heading size because as you increase the number on the &lt;h&gt; tag, the smaller the heading becomes...</p>

            <h2>See how it got smaller...but it still has the same style</h2>
            <p>This is done with the &lt;h2&gt; tag.</p>

            <p>Ima show you a "real" paragrah with the &lt;p&gt; tag. blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah. Does it look like a paragraph yet? I think my work is done.</p>
